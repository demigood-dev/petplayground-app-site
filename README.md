# PetPlayground App Site

🏠 This repository will host the production version of the **PetPlayground** website, available at [https://petplayground.app](https://petplayground.app).

This site will later serve as the **main entry point for users**, providing the full application interface and interaction experience with the AI Domina.

---

### 🔧 Project Status

This is a placeholder for now.  
The full production version will be deployed here once development reaches the public release stage.

---

### 📌 Notes

- This repo is separate from [`petplayground-dev-site`](https://github.com/demigood-dev/petplayground-dev-site)), which is used for the MVP and documentation.
- The domain `petplayground.app` is already purchased and will be linked via GitHub Pages when ready.
